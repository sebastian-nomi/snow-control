Enter one of the following options: 
{bright}{cyan}clear{end}:   clears the current caches(all of them)
{bright}{green}get{end}:    refreshes the current cached registry of SF objects
{bright}{green}plan{end}:   uses the current cached registry of SF objects combined with the current role config to plan changes and generate a cached snowplan file in the account. 
{bright}{green}user{end}:   uses the generated cached snowplan + the user config to show changes at the user level
{bright}{green}show{end}:   uses the generated cached snowplan to show the exact SQL queries that will be executed
{bright}{green}apply{end}:  uses the generated cached snowplan to run the queries
{bright}{yellow}debug{end}: sets the debugging verbosity level (default is 3)
{bright}{red} exit {end}:   exit this screen

You can add either 'seq' or 'conc' after each step to make sure the code executes in a specific manner
{bright}{yellow}seq{end}        (default for apply) code is executed sequentially for optimal debugging/visibility
{bright}{yellow}conc{end}       (default for get/plan) code is executed concurrently for optimal performance

Example commands: 
-   {yellow}get{end}
-   {yellow}plan seq{end}
-   {yellow}apply conc{end}
